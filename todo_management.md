# Technical Exercise: Task Management System

## Objective:
Create a simple task management system that allows users to add, list, and filter tasks based on their status.

## Requirements:

### Task Management:
1. Implement a class or module for managing tasks.
2. Tasks should have the following attributes: title, description, status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done"), and due date.

### User Interface:
1. Develop a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the task management system.
2. Users should be able to add a new task with a title, description, status, and optional due date.
3. Display a list of tasks with their details, including status and due date.
4. Implement a filter option to display tasks based on their status (e.g., show only "To Do" tasks).

## Guidelines:
- Use Python for the implementation.
- Structure your code in a modular and readable manner.
- Implement error handling for user input and any potential issues.

## Bonus:
- Allow users to mark tasks as complete or change their status.
- Implement a sorting mechanism for tasks based on due date or status.
- Store tasks persistently (e.g., in a file) so that they are not lost when the program is restarted.

Feel free to interpret and implement the exercise in a way that showcases your problem-solving and coding skills. The goal is to create a functional and user-friendly task management system.
