# Technical Interview Practice Repository

Welcome to the Technical Interview Practice Repository! This repository contains a set of technical exercises designed to help you practice and improve your coding skills. Each exercise focuses on a specific problem or scenario commonly encountered in technical interviews.

## Exercises

### 1. User Management Application
Create a user management application that interacts with the "https://randomuser.me/api/" API. The application should display user cards, implement pagination, and provide basic search functionality.

### 2. Task Management System
Develop a task management system that allows users to add, list, and filter tasks based on their status. The system should have a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.

### 3. URL Shortener
Build a simple URL shortener service that generates short URLs for long URLs. Users should also be able to retrieve the original long URL using the short URL.

### 4. Weather Forecast Application
Create a weather forecast application that fetches current weather information and provides a five-day forecast for a given city. The application can use a public weather API for data retrieval.

## Guidelines for Each Exercise
- Structure your code in a modular and readable manner.
- Implement error handling for invalid input and potential issues.
- Add unit tests to validate the correctness of your functions or classes.
- Feel free to extend the exercises or add bonus features based on your preferences.
