# Technical Exercise: URL Shortener

## Objective:
Develop a simple URL shortener service that takes a long URL as input and generates a short URL. Additionally, users should be able to retrieve the original URL by using the short URL.

## Requirements:

### URL Shortening:
1. Create a function or class for generating a short URL from a given long URL.
2. The short URL should be unique for each long URL.

### URL Retrieval:
1. Implement a function or class for retrieving the original long URL using the short URL.

### User Interface:
1. Develop a command-line interface (CLI) or a simple web interface for users to interact with the URL shortener service.
2. Allow users to input a long URL and receive the corresponding short URL.
3. Provide an option to input a short URL and retrieve the original long URL.

## Guidelines:
- Use the langage you want for the implementation.
- Consider the trade-offs between URL uniqueness, length, and simplicity in your design.
- Ensure that the short URLs are not easily guessable.
- Implement error handling for invalid input and any potential issues.

## Bonus:
- Implement an expiration mechanism for short URLs.
- Keep track of the usage statistics for each short URL (e.g., the number of times it has been accessed).
- Consider implementing a persistent storage mechanism for long and short URL mappings.

Feel free to interpret and implement the exercise in a way that demonstrates your coding skills and creativity. The goal is to create a functional and efficient URL shortener service.
