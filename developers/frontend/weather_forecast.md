# Technical Exercise: Weather Forecast Application

## Objective:
Develop a weather forecast application that retrieves and displays the current weather information for a given city. The application should also provide a simple five-day forecast.

## Requirements:

### Weather Data:
1. Utilize a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack) to fetch current weather data.
2. Implement a function or class to retrieve and parse the current weather information for a specified city.

### Forecast:
1. Extend the application to include a five-day weather forecast.
2. Implement a function or class to retrieve and display the forecast for the next five days for a given city.

### User Interface:
1. Create a simple command-line interface (CLI) or a web interface for users to interact with the weather forecast application.
2. Allow users to input a city name and receive the current weather information and the five-day forecast.

## Guidelines:
- Use the langage you want for the implementation.
- Ensure that the application gracefully handles invalid input and potential API request errors.
- Structure your code in a modular and readable manner.

## Bonus:
- Add unit tests to validate the correctness of your functions or classes.
- Enhance the user interface to provide a more user-friendly experience.
- Allow users to specify additional parameters for the weather data, such as temperature units (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit).

Feel free to interpret and implement the exercise in a way that showcases your problem-solving skills and coding proficiency. The goal is to create a functional and informative weather forecast application.
