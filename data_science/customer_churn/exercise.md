# Exercise: Predictive Modeling for Customer Churn

## Objective:
Develop a predictive model to identify potential customer churn for a telecommunications company. The dataset provided contains information about customer demographics, usage patterns, and whether or not they churned.

## Dataset:
The dataset (churn_data.csv) consists of the following columns:

* CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
* Gender: Customer gender (Male/Female).
* SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (1) or not (0).
* Partner: Whether the customer has a partner (Yes/No).
* Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents (Yes/No).
* Tenure: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company.
* PhoneService: Whether the customer has a phone service (Yes/No).
* MultipleLines: Whether the customer has multiple lines (Yes/No/No phone service).
* InternetService: Type of internet service (DSL/Fiber optic/No).
* OnlineSecurity: Whether the customer has online security (Yes/No/No internet service).
* OnlineBackup: Whether the customer has online backup (Yes/No/No internet service).
* DeviceProtection: Whether the customer has device protection (Yes/No/No internet service).
* TechSupport: Whether the customer has tech support (Yes/No/No internet service).
* StreamingTV: Whether the customer has streaming TV (Yes/No/No internet service).
* StreamingMovies: Whether the customer has streaming movies (Yes/No/No internet service).
* Contract: Type of contract the customer has (Month-to-month/One year/Two years).
* PaperlessBilling: Whether the customer has paperless billing (Yes/No).
* PaymentMethod: Payment method used by the customer.
* MonthlyCharges: Monthly charges for the customer.
* TotalCharges: Total charges for the customer.
* Churn: Whether the customer churned (Yes/No).

## Tasks:

1. Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. Preprocess the data as needed, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for predictive modeling.
5. Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.
6. Fine-tune the model if necessary, considering hyperparameter tuning.
7. Interpret the results and provide insights into key factors influencing customer churn.

## Note:
Feel free to use any programming language or tools you are comfortable with (e.g., Python, R, or others). Additionally, you may choose from various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or others based on your expertise. Document your code, choices, and results clearly.
