# Exercise: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Sentiment Analysis

## Objective:
Develop a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The dataset provided contains a collection of movie reviews labeled with their corresponding sentiments.

## Dataset:
The dataset (movie_reviews.csv) consists of the following columns:

* ReviewID: Unique identifier for each movie review.
* ReviewText: The text content of the movie review.
* Sentiment: The sentiment label (Positive/Negative).

## Tasks:

1. Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. Preprocess the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and performing stemming or lemmatization.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Choose a suitable NLP model (e.g., Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings) for sentiment analysis.
5. Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.
6. Experiment with different classification algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Neural Networks) and compare their performance.
7. Fine-tune the model parameters and preprocessing steps for optimal results.
8. Visualize the results, including a confusion matrix and accuracy metrics.
9. Provide insights into the most influential words or features contributing to positive and negative sentiments.

Note:
Feel free to use any programming language or tools you are comfortable with (e.g., Python with libraries such as NLTK, scikit-learn, or TensorFlow). Choose appropriate preprocessing techniques and algorithms based on the characteristics of the dataset. Document your code, choices, and results clearly.
