# Exercise: Time Series Forecasting with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

## Objective:
Build a time series forecasting model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict future values in a given time series dataset.

## Dataset:
Utilize a time series dataset, such as stock prices, temperature readings, or any sequential data. For this example, consider using a synthetic time series dataset with a defined pattern.

##Tasks:
1. Load and explore the time series dataset to understand its structure and patterns.
2. Preprocess the time series data, handling missing values and normalizing the values if necessary.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets, considering the temporal order of the data.
4. Design an LSTM network architecture suitable for time series forecasting.
5. Train the LSTM model on the training set and validate its performance on the testing set.
6. Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as the number of LSTM layers, units, and sequence length.
7. Visualize the training process, including loss curves and predicted versus actual values.
8. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics for time series forecasting (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error).
9. Fine-tune the model and analyze the impact of different architectural choices on forecasting accuracy.
10. Predict future values in the time series and compare them with the actual values.

Note:
Use a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to implement the LSTM network. Document your code, model architecture, and results clearly. Provide insights into challenges related to time series forecasting and how LSTM networks address them. If possible, compare the LSTM model's performance with a baseline model, such as a simple moving average.
