# Technical Exercise: User Management Application

## Objective:
Develop a user management application that interacts with the "https://randomuser.me/api/" API. The application should display user information, implement pagination, and provide a basic search functionality.

## Requirements:

### API Integration:
1. Create a module or component responsible for fetching data from the "https://randomuser.me/api/" API.
2. Implement a function or method to retrieve a list of users (e.g., 10 users) from the API.

### User Display:
1. Display user information retrieved from the API, such as name, picture, and any other relevant details.
2. Format the user information in a clean and visually appealing manner.

### Pagination:
1. Develop a mechanism to paginate through the list of users.
2. Provide a way to load the next set of users (e.g., 10 more) when requested.

### Search Functionality:
1. Implement a basic search functionality to filter users based on their attributes (e.g., name, email).
2. Update the displayed user list dynamically as the user types in the search input.

## Guidelines:
- Use suitable programming languages and technologies for the task.
- Organize your code in a modular and maintainable way.
- Ensure error handling for any potential issues, such as failed API requests.

## Bonus:
- Allow customization of the number of users displayed per page.
- Enhance the user interface to improve user experience.
- Implement any additional features that showcase creativity and problem-solving skills.
